### Key Implementation Notes ###

Don't touch the function definitions (only the contents) for 'player1PlaceShip' and 'player1Action' - it will crash the program
The data passed to these functions is essentially the same as for the C implementation, except using lists rather than arrays
 - board is a 1D list
 - remaining_ships is a 1D list (5 elements, true or false for hit or sunk)
 - history is a nested list
    - last element is the most recent
    - elements are [x,y,hit]

The C macro/enum constants are provided automatically by the main program, such as ship and square ids, and the board size


### Important details ###

For an unknown reason, modification of global variables (variables defined outside the scope of a function) from inside 
 functions will crash the program. If you want to preserve variables between function calls, which also being able to modify
 them, use function attributes 
 (a helper decorator has been provided for you - example is in+above the default `player1Action` function)
